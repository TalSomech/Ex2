# WELCOME TO THE POCKEMON GAME!

> What Is The Pokemon Game?

This game demonstrates a directed wighted graph, pokemons of two kinds and pokeballs that have to catch them.

There are 24 levels and 6 differnet types of graphs!

*The goal* is for the pokeballs to find the best way to catch as many pockemons as they can!

Each pokemon has a different value, and as your pokeballs eat more pokemons they get faster and faster.

You would want your pokeballs to spread around the graph and eat a bunch of pokemons together.
